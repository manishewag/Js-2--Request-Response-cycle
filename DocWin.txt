Difference between documents and window objects

Document Object:
The document object represents a web page that is loaded in the browser. By accessing the document object, we can access the element in the HTML page. With the help of document objects, we can add dynamic content to our web page. The document object can be accessed with a window.document or just document.

The W3C Document Object Model (DOM) is a platform-neutral interface that enables dynamic access and updating of a document’s content, structure, and style by programs and scripts.

The DOM manipulation tool offers methods to access and manipulate the structure and content of a document, such as getElementById(), querySelector(), createElement(), and innerHTML. It represents the entire HTML document as a node tree, with the Document object as the root node. It allows dynamic updates and interactions with web page content.

Few properties and methods of Document Object Model,

Properties

element.innerHTML = new html content//Change the inner HTML of an element

element.attribute = new value//Change the attribute value of an HTML element

Methods

document.createElement(element)//Create an HTML element

document.removeChild(element)//Remove an HTML element



Window Object
The Window object is a global object in client-side JavaScript, representing the browser window containing a DOM document and acting as the root of the document object model.

The window object, supported by all browsers, represents the browser’s window and automatically includes global JavaScript objects, functions, and variables as members.

The Window object is responsible for managing global variables, functions, and objects, providing methods for browser interaction and managing properties related to frames, tabs, or windows, such as alert(), confirm(), setTimeout(), and setInterval().

Few properties and methods of window objects are,

Properties

window.innerHeight - the inner height of the browser window (in pixels)

window.innerWidth - the inner width of the browser window (in pixels)

Methods

window.open() - open a new window

window.close() - close the current window

window.moveTo() - move the current window

window.resizeTo() - resize the current window
